## Overview

The CoachmarkOverlayElement is a composable element reserved for use within a
CoachmarkOverlayElements container, which should be used only within the scope
of a Coachmark or a CoachmarkFixed component. There can be one to N number of
CoachmarkOverlayElement components as children to a single
CoachmarkOverlayElements. When more than one CoachmarkOverlayElement components
are used in a CoachmarkOverlayElements, the components are displayed in a
paginated fashion within a carousel.

## About Novice to pro

[Novice to pro](https://pages.github.ibm.com/security/security-design/department/end-to-end-experiences/novice-to-pro/overview/)
is a continuous learning methodology and framework that aims to orient, onboard,
explain, educate, and cultivate novice users into high-functioning power users.

## Note on theming

The CoachmarkOverlayElement does not directly take a theme prop; rather, it
relies on the cascade from classes being set in the
Coachmark/CoachmarkFixed/CoachmarkStack components.

## Example usage

<Canvas className="coachmarkExample" withSource="none">
  <div className="CoachmarkBaseExampleUsage">
    <Story of={CoachmarkOverlayElementStories.coachmarkOverlayElement} />
  </div>
</Canvas>
