## Overview

The CoachmarkOverlayElements is a composable container element, which should be
used only within the scope of a Coachmark or a CoachmarkFixed component. The
CoachmarkOverlayElements can contain one to N number of CoachmarkOverlayElement
components as children. When more than one CoachmarkOverlayElement component is
used in a CoachmarkOverlayElements, the components are displayed in a paginated
fashion within a carousel.

## Note on theming

relies on the cascade from classes being set in the Coachmark / CoachmarkFixed /
CoachmarkStack components.
